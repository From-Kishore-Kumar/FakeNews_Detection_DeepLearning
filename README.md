# FakeNews_Detection_DeepLearning

## Overview
This project demonstrates a fake news detection model using TensorFlow in Python. The model processes news article data, uses word embeddings for representation, and leverages a neural network for classification, distinguishing between fake and real news.

## Dataset
News Dataset: news.csv
GloVe Embeddings: glove.6B.50d.txt
