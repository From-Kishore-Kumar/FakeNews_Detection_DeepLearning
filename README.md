# FakeNews_Detection_DeepLearning

## Overview
This project demonstrates a fake news detection model using TensorFlow in Python. The model processes news article data, uses word embeddings for representation, and leverages a neural network for classification, distinguishing between fake and real news.

## Dataset
News Dataset: [news.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XoHoUjZtLQ6gh_CPv9_igtZoEsdkgq3t/view) <br />
GloVe Embeddings: [glove.6B.50d.txt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ekbxlI_GdF3H_XHS8U2Csj5q5AhNXhMp/view)
